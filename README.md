## üõ†Ô∏è Self-Hosting Guide

For optimal performance and privacy compared to the public instance, you can self-host the addon using Cloudflare Workers:

> **Note**
>
> AIOCatalogs must be deployed on Cloudflare's infrastructure for production use. As we are using the D1 database, we need to use wrangler to add data to the database.

### ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloudflare Deployment

Deploy to Cloudflare's global edge network for optimal performance:

```bash
# Clone the repository
$ git clone https://github.com/pantelx/aiocatalogs.git && cd aiocatalogs
# Install dependencies
$ npm i
# Log in to Cloudflare
$ wrangler login
# Create D1 database
$ wrangler d1 create aiocatalogs
# Insert the returned database ID in `wrangler.toml`
# Apply migrations
$ wrangler d1 migrations apply aiocatalogs --remote
# Deploy to Cloudflare
$ npm run deploy
```

---

### üíª Development Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
$ git clone https://github.com/pantelx/aiocatalogs.git && cd aiocatalogs
# Install dependencies
$ npm i
# Build the addon
$ npm run build
# Apply local migrations
$ wrangler d1 migrations apply aiocatalogs
# Cloudflare worker development with locally simulated D1 database
$ npm run dev
```

> **Note**
>
> The development mode uses a locally simulated Cloudflare D1 database. You only need to deploy to Cloudflare when moving to production.

### üìù Preview your changes

Preview your changes before deploying to Cloudflare:

```bash
$ npm run preview
```

### üìù Release Process

Bump the version, release and publish to npm:

```bash
$ npm run release
```

## ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions

### What is AIOCatalogs?

AIOCatalogs is an addon that combines multiple catalog addons into a single addon. It allows you to search and discover content from various sources in a single addon, without having to install multiple addons individually.

### Why can't I self-host the addon via docker or from source (with node)?

From now on, AIOCatalogs will no longer be possible to self-host via docker or from source (with node). This step is necessary to achieve a standardised structure of the code and to make it easier to add features or fix bugs. Due to the different data storage approaches, I had to implement most functions twice, which led to bugs and significantly more debugging. Starting now, AIOCatalogs will only use the cloudflare D1 database, which means I will have to use wrangler to add data to the database. The alternative would be to use the cloudflare API, but this leads to a significant increase in latency, so I decided against it. The addon can still be self-hosted via cloudflare workers.

### How do I configure the addon to work with cloudflare workers?

You can configure the addon using environment variables:

- **Cloudflare Configuration**: Configure the D1 database in the `wrangler.toml` file
- **Environment Variables**:

  - `AIOCATALOGS_API_CACHE_EXPIRATION_MDBLIST`: Cache expiration time in minutes for MDBList API (default: 60)
  - `AIOCATALOGS_API_CACHE_EXPIRATION_RPDB`: Cache expiration time in days for RPDB API (default: 7)
  - `AIOCATALOGS_API_MAX_ITEMS_MDBLIST`: Maximum number of items to fetch from MDBList API (default: 100)
  - `AIOCATALOGS_API_MAX_REQUESTS`: Maximum number of requests per minute (default: 60)
  - `AIOCATALOGS_API_RATE_LIMIT`: Enable rate limiting (default: true)
  - `AIOCATALOGS_TRUSTED_ORIGINS`: List of trusted origins for redirects (comma-separated URLs)

  - `LOG_LEVEL`: Log level (default: info)
  - `LOG_ENABLE_TIMESTAMPS`: Enable timestamps in logs (default: true)
  - `LOG_TIMESTAMP_FORMAT`: Timestamp format (default: dd.MM.yyyy HH:mm:ss)
  - `LOG_TIMEZONE`: Timezone for timestamps (default: Europe/Berlin)

### How do I add new catalog addons?

1. Open the addon's web interface at your installation URL
2. Click "Create New Configuration" to create a new user ID
3. Add catalog addons by entering their manifest URLs or by clicking the "Add MDBList Catalog" button
4. Configure display options like RPDB rating posters for enhanced visual feedback
5. Install the addon in Stremio using the displayed URL

### Why can't I find specific content?

If you can't find specific content, check the following:

1. Is the source addon correctly configured?
2. Is the source addon currently accessible?
3. Does the source addon offer the desired content at all?

### How can I use the MDBList integration?

To use the MDBList integration:

1. Obtain an API key from [MDBList](https://mdblist.com/)
2. Enter your API key in the configuration panel
3. Browse and select from MDBList Top100 collections or search for specific collections
4. The selected collections will be automatically added as catalogs

### What are RPDB rating posters?

RPDB (Rating Posters Database) adds visual rating indicators directly on content posters. This feature:

- Makes it easier to identify highly-rated content at a glance
- Pulls ratings from trusted sources
- Can be toggled on/off per catalog configuration
